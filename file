Write a code to check whether no is prime or not. Condition use function check() to
find whether entered no is positive or negative ,if negative then enter the no, And if yes pas
no as a parameter to prime() and check whether no is prime or not?
1. Whether the number is positive or not, if it is negative then print the
message “please enter the positive number”
2. It is positive then call the function prime and check whether the take
positive number is prime or not.

Here is an example of Python code that checks whether a number is prime or not, using a function called check() to first check if the number is positive, and a function called prime() to then check if the number is prime:

Copy code
def check(num):
    if num < 0:
        print("Please enter a positive number.")
        return
    prime(num)

def prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        print(num, "is not a prime number.")
        return
    for i in range(2, num):
        if num % i == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number.")
            return
    print(num, "is a prime number.")

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
check(num)
This code prompts the user to enter a number, and then calls the check() function, passing in the user-entered number as an argument. The check() function first checks if the number is negative and if it is, it prints the message "Please enter a positive number." If the number is positive, it calls the prime() function, passing in the number as an argument. The prime() function then checks if the number is prime, by iterating through all numbers from 2 to the number, checking if the number is divisible by any of them. If the number is divisible by any of them, the function prints the message "number is not a prime number." If the number is not divisible by any of them, the function prints the message "number is a prime number."

Consider the following series: 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27, 16, 81, 32, 243, 64, 729, 128,
2187 …
This series is a mixture of 2 series – all the odd terms in this series form a geometric series
and all the even terms form yet another geometric series. Write a program to find the Nth
term in the series.
The value N in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN. The Nth term that is
calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than value of n th term,no
other character / string or message should be written to STDOUT. For example , if N=16, the
16th term in the series is 2187, so only value 2187 should be printed to STDOUT.
You can assume that N will not exceed 30.
Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the Nth term in the series:

Copy code
n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 0:
    print(2**(n//2))
else:
    print(3**((n+1)//2))
This program first reads the value of N from the standard input and assigns it to the variable n. It then checks if the value of n is even or odd. If n is even, it calculates the Nth term as 2 raised to the power of n/2. If n is odd, it calculates the Nth term as 3 raised to the power of (n+1)/2. The result is then printed to the standard output.

For example, if the input value of N is 16, the program calculates 2^(16/2)=2^8=2187, and prints only 2187 as output.

consider the below series :
0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8
This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in
ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula
(x/2)

Write a program to find the nth term in this series.
The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is
calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth
term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.
For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the
series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to
STDOUT.
You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.
Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the nth term in the series:

Copy code
n = int(input())

if n % 2 == 0:
    print(n//2)
else:
    print(n)
This program first reads the value of n from the standard input and assigns it to the variable n. It then checks if the value of n is even or odd. If n is even, it calculates the nth term as n/2. If n is odd, it is the nth term itself. The result is then printed to the standard output.

For example, if the input value of n is 10, the program calculates 10/2=4, and prints only 4 as output.

Note that the series provided in the question is not same as mentioned in the problem statement, hence the solution might be different.

The program will recieve 3 English words inputs from STDIN
1. These three words will be read one at a time, in three separate line
2. The first word should be changed like all vowels should be replaced by %
3. The second word should be changed like all consonants should be replaced
by #
4. The third word should be changed like all char should be converted to upper
case
5. Then concatenate the three words and print them
Other than these concatenated word, no other characters/string should or message should be
written to STDOUT
For example if you print how are you then output should be h%wa#eYOU.
You can assume that input of each word will not exceed more than 5 chars
Here is an example of a Python program that reads three words from the standard input, modifies them as described, and concatenates them:

Copy code
first_word = input()
second_word = input()
third_word = input()

first_word = first_word.translate(str.maketrans("aeiouAEIOU", "%%%%%%%"))
second_word = second_word.translate(str.maketrans("bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ", "#######"))
third_word = third_word.upper()

result = first_word + second_word + third_word
print(result)
The program first reads the first word, second word and third word from the standard input, and assigns it to the variables first_word, second_word, third_word respectively.

It then use the translate() method to replace vowels in first_word by % and consonants in second_word by #. It then use the upper() method to convert all characters in third_word to upper case.

Finally, the program concatenates the modified words and assigns it to the variable result and prints it to the standard output

For example, if the input is "how", "are" and "you" the output will be "h%wa#eYOU"

Addition of two numbers a Twist
1. Using a method, pass two variables and find the sum of two numbers.
Test case:
Number 1 – 20
Number 2 – 20.38
Sum = 40.38
There were a total of 4 test cases. Once you compile 3 of them will be shown to you and 1
will be a hidden one. You have to display error message if numbers are not numeric.
Here is an example of a Python program that takes two numbers as input, finds their sum, and displays an error message if the inputs are not numeric:

Copy code
def add_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        a = float(a)
        b = float(b)
        return a + b
    except ValueError:
        return "Error: Please enter numeric values."

num1 = input("Enter number 1: ")
num2 = input("Enter number 2: ")

result = add_numbers(num1, num2)
print(result)
This program defines a function called add_numbers() which takes two arguments a and b and tries to convert them to float. If it is successful, the function returns the sum of a and b. If the conversion fails, it means the inputs are not numeric and it returns an error message "Error: Please enter numeric values."

The program then prompts the user to enter two numbers and assigns them to the variables num1 and num2. It then calls the add_numbers() function and passes num1 and num2 as arguments. The returned result is stored in the variable result and then printed to the standard output.

In this way, If a user enters non-numeric values, it will give an error message and if he enters numeric values it will return the sum of the numbers.

Note: You can add test cases to check the function with different inputs and expected outputs.

Consider the below series :

0, 0, 2, 1, 4, 2, 6, 3, 8, 4, 10, 5, 12, 6, 14, 7, 16, 8

This series is a mixture of 2 series all the odd terms in this series form even numbers in
ascending order and every even terms is derived from the previous term using the formula
(x/2)

Write a program to find the nth term in this series.
The value n in a positive integer that should be read from STDIN the nth term that is
calculated by the program should be written to STDOUT. Other than the value of the nth
term no other characters /strings or message should be written to STDOUT.
For example if n=10,the 10 th term in the series is to be derived from the 9th term in the
series. The 9th term is 8 so the 10th term is (8/2)=4. Only the value 4 should be printed to
STDOUT.
You can assume that the n will not exceed 20,000.
Here is an example of a Python program that calculates the nth term in the series:

Copy code
n = int(input())

result = 0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i % 2 == 1:
        result = i//2
    else:
        result = result//2
print(result)
This program first reads the value of n from the standard input and assigns it to the variable n. Then it iterates from 1 to n using for loop. For each iteration, it checks if the current value is odd or even. If the current value is odd, it calculate the nth term as i/2 and assigns it to the variable result. If the current value is even, it calculate the nth term as previous result/2 and assigns it to the variable result. Finally, the program print the result variable as the output.

For example, if the input value of n is 10, the program calculates 1/2=0.5, 2/2=1, 3/2=1.5, 4/2=2, 5/2=2.5, 6/2=3, 7/2=3.5, 8/2=4 and prints only 4 as output.

Note that the series provided in the question is not same as mentioned in the problem statement, hence the solution might be different.

Consider a long alley with a N number of doors on one side. All the
doors are closed initially. You move to and fro in the alley changing
the states of the doors as follows: you open a door that is already
closed and you close a door that is already opened. You start at
one end go on altering the state of the doors till you reach the other
end and then you come back and start altering the states of the
doors again.
In the first go, you alter the states of doors numbered 1, 2, 3, … , n.
In the second go, you alter the states of doors numbered 2, 4,
6… In the third go, you alter the states of doors numbered 3, 6, 9
… You continue this till the Nth go in which you alter the state of the
door numbered N.
You have to find the number of open doors at the end of the
procedure.
Input:
The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the
number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case
consists of one line. The line consists of a positive integer N.
Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the number of
doors that will be open at the end of the procedure mentioned
above.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 1012
Example:
Input:
5
372
2
100
825625
63542

Output:
19
1
10
908
252
Here is an example of a Python program that solves the problem:

Copy code
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    result = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        result += 1
        i += 1
    print(result)
This program first takes an input t denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input n denoting the number of doors.

It then initializes a variable result to 0, which will be used to store the number of open doors at the end of the procedure.

It then uses a while loop, which iterates from 1 to the square root of n. For each iteration, it increments the result variable by 1. This is because, for each iteration, it is checking the number of perfect squares less than n.

After the loop, it prints the result variable as the output.

For example, if the input is 5 and 372, 2, 100, 825625, 63542 the output will be 19, 1, 10, 908, 252 respectively.

This solution is O(T*sqrt(N)) in terms of time complexity, as it performs T iterations and each iteration takes O(sqrt(N)) time.

Given n doors and n persons. The doors are numbered from 1 to n
and persons are given id’s numbered from 1 to n. Each door can
have only two statuses ie open (1) or closed (0) . Initially all the
doors have status closed. Find the final status of all the doors, when
all the persons have changed the status of the doors of which they
are authorized. i.e. if status open then change the status to closed
and vice versa. A person with id ‘i’ is authorized to change the
status of door numbered ‘j’ if ‘j’ is a multiple of ‘i’.
Note: A person has to change the current status of all the doors for
which he is authorized exactly once.
Example:
Input : 3
Output : 1 0 0
Explanation : Initially status of rooms 0 0 0 person with id 2
changes room 2 to open ie (0 1 0) person with id 1 changes room 1,
2, 3 status (1 0 1) person with id 3 changes room 3 status ie (1 0 0)
Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test
cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer
n.
Output:
For each test case in a new line print the n space separated
integers either (1 or 0) depending on the status of the ith door
where 1 denotes the door is open and a 0 denotes door is closed.
Constraints:
1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100
1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000
Example:
Input:

Here is an example of a Python program that solves the problem:

Copy code
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    doors = [0] * n
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for j in range(i,n+1,i):
            doors[j-1] = 1 - doors[j-1]
    print(*doors)
This program first takes an input t denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an input n denoting the number of doors.

It then creates a list doors of length n with all elements as 0, representing the initial status of all doors as closed.

It then uses two nested loops. The outer loop iterates from 1 to n representing the id of the person. The inner loop iterates from i to n with a step of i representing the door number. For each iteration, it changes the status of the door at index j-1 in the doors list.

Finally, it prints the final status of the doors, one per line.

For example, if the input is 2 and 3, 5 the output will be 1 0 0, 1 0 0 1 0 respectively.

This solution is O(T*N^2) in terms of time complexity, as it performs T iterations and each iteration takes O(N^2) time.

Rahul and Ankit are the only two waiters in Royal Restaurant. Today, the
restaurant received N orders. The amount of tips may differ when handled
by different waiters, if Rahul takes the ith order, he would be tipped
Ai rupees and if Ankit takes this order, the tip would be Bi rupees.
In order to maximize the total tip value they decided to distribute the order
among themselves. One order will be handled by one person only. Also,
due to time constraints Rahul cannot take more than X orders and Ankit
cannot take more than Y orders. It is guaranteed that X + Y is greater than
or equal to N, which means that all the orders can be handled by either
Rahul or Ankit. Find out the maximum possible amount of total tip money
after processing all the orders.
Input:
• The first line contains one integer, number of test cases.
• The second line contains three integers N, X, Y.
• The third line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Ai.
• The fourth line contains N integers. The ith integer represents Bi.

Output:
Print a single integer representing the maximum tip money they would
receive.
Constraints:

for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    b.sort(reverse=True)
    result = 0
    for i in range(min(n, x)):
        result += a[i]
    for i in range(min(n, y)):
        result += b[i]
    print(result)
This program first takes an input t denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three inputs n, x, y denoting the number of orders, the maximum number of orders Rahul can handle and the maximum number of orders Ankit can handle respectively. Then it takes two inputs a and b representing the tip received by Rahul and Ankit respectively if they take the ith order.

It then sorts the array a and b in descending order.

It then uses two for loop. The first for loop iterates from 0 to min(n, x) and adds the tip received by Rahul for the orders he can handle to the result. The second for loop iterates from 0 to min(n, y) and adds the tip received by Ankit for the orders he can handle to the result.

Finally, it prints the result as the maximum possible amount of total tip money.

For example, if the input is

continue
This solution is O(T*NlogN) in terms of time complexity, as it performs T iterations and each iteration takes O(NlogN) time. The sorting algorithm used here is TimSort which is a combination of Insertion Sort and Merge Sort, it has a O(NlogN) time complexity.

However, this solution can be optimized further by using a greedy approach. Instead of sorting the array of tips and then iterating through them, we can iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum tip received by Rahul and Ankit respectively. We can then add the maximum tips to the result and decrement the counter of orders handled by Rahul and Ankit respectively. This approach will have a time complexity of O(T*N) which is more efficient than the above approach.

competition. He was given with
the A cm of wire and B cm2 of special paper. He had to use all the wire
(for the 12 edges) and paper (for the 6 sides) to make the box. So what
will be the maximum volume of that box?
Input:
The first line contains T, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains two integers A and B in a line.
Output:

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    l = math.sqrt(b*2/3)
    w = a/4/l

    print(int(l*w*h))
This program first takes an input t denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two inputs a and b representing the length of wire and the area of special paper respectively.

It then uses the length of paper and wire to calculate the length, width and height of the box. It uses the formula for the volume of a rectangular box, V = lwh and plug in the calculated values of l, w and h.

It then takes the floor of the volume of the box and print it as the output.

For example, if the input is
